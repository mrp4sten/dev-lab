# 300 Links

## Purpose

This is your **bookmark and reference library**. Store links to external resources -- articles, videos, documentation, tools, and anything you want to revisit later.

## How to Use

1. **Save links** with a brief description of what the resource covers and why it's useful.
2. **Tag or categorize** links by topic so they're easy to find.
3. **Link back to related notes** in `100 Notes/` or MOCs in `000 Index/` so resources are connected to the concepts they support.

## What Belongs Here

- Article links with summaries or key takeaways
- Video/course links with progress notes
- Documentation references
- Tool and library links
- Stack Overflow answers or GitHub repos worth remembering

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Your own written notes or analysis (those go in `100 Notes/`)
- Full project documentation (those go in `400 Projects/`)

## Suggested Format

```markdown
# Resource Title

**URL:** [Link](https://example.com)
**Type:** Article / Video / Course / Docs / Tool
**Topic:** [[Related Concept]]
**Status:** To Read / In Progress / Completed

## Key Takeaways
- Point 1
- Point 2
```

## Tips

- Don't just hoard links -- add at least one sentence about why you saved it.
- Periodically review this folder and move insights into proper concept notes in `100 Notes/`.
- Use status tags to track what you've actually consumed vs. what's still in your reading queue.

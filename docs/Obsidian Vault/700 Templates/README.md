# 700 Templates

## Purpose

This directory contains **reusable templates** for creating consistent, well-structured notes across your vault. Templates save time and ensure you capture all the important information every time.

## How to Use

1. **Insert a template** when creating a new note: use the Obsidian core plugin "Templates" or the community plugin "Templater".
2. **Configure the templates folder** in Obsidian: go to **Settings > Templates > Template folder location** and set it to `700 Templates`.
3. **Fill in the placeholders** (marked with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`) after inserting a template.

## Available Templates

| Template | Use For | Create Notes In |
|---|---|---|
| `001 Concept` | Learning a new concept or technique | `100 Notes/` |
| `002 Problem` | Documenting a problem and solution | `100 Notes/` |
| `003 Project` | Tracking a hands-on project | `400 Projects/` |
| `004 Weekly Review` | Weekly reflection and planning | `200 Day Notes/` |
| `005 Daily Note` | Daily study log and journal | `200 Day Notes/` |
| `006 MOC` | Map of Content for a topic | `000 Index/` |
| `007 Meeting` | Meeting notes and action items | `100 Notes/` |
| `008 Make journal` | Maker/builder journal entries | `200 Day Notes/` |
| `009 Tasks` | Task management and prioritization | `500 Todo/` |

## What Belongs Here

- Markdown template files only
- Templates should contain placeholders, not actual content

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Filled-in notes (those go in their respective directories)
- Images or attachments (those go in `600 Images/`)

## Tips

- Don't modify templates casually -- changes affect all future notes using that template.
- If you want to customize a template for a specific use case, create a new numbered template (e.g., `010 Custom.md`).
- Keep the numbering sequential so templates stay organized.
- Review your templates periodically and update them as your workflow evolves.

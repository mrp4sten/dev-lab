# 400 Projects

## Purpose

This is where you document your **hands-on projects**. Each project gets its own note tracking goals, architecture, implementation progress, challenges, and lessons learned.

## How to Use

1. **Create a new note** for each project using the `003 Project` template from `700 Templates/`.
2. **Define your goals** -- both the project objective and the learning goals you want to achieve.
3. **Log your implementation** phase by phase (Setup, Core Features, Testing, Deployment).
4. **Document challenges** as you encounter them, including how you solved them and what you learned.
5. **Update progress** regularly so the note reflects the current state of the project.

## What Belongs Here

- Project documentation notes (one per project)
- Architecture decisions and design notes
- Implementation logs and progress tracking
- Post-project retrospectives

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Generic concept notes (those go in `100 Notes/`)
- Daily progress logs (those go in `200 Day Notes/`, then link here)
- Task lists not tied to a specific project (those go in `500 Todo/`)

## Naming Convention

Use clear project names, e.g.:
- `REST API with Spring Boot`
- `Portfolio Website`
- `Chat Application`

## Tips

- Link concepts from `100 Notes/` in the "Concepts Applied" section to reinforce learning.
- Keep the "What I Learned" section updated -- this is gold for interviews and future projects.
- Include code snippets you're proud of or want to remember.
- Update the completion percentage and status regularly.

# 600 Images

## Purpose

This is the **attachment storage** for your vault. All images, diagrams, screenshots, and visual assets referenced in your notes are stored here.

## How to Use

1. **Drag and drop** images into this folder, or configure Obsidian to save attachments here automatically.
2. **Reference images** from any note using the syntax: `![[image-name.png]]`
3. **Use descriptive filenames** so you can find images later without opening them.

## Obsidian Configuration

To auto-save pasted images here, go to:
**Settings > Files & Links > Default location for new attachments** and set it to `600 Images`.

## What Belongs Here

- Screenshots used in notes
- Diagrams (architecture, flowcharts, UML)
- Exported whiteboard images
- Any visual asset referenced in your vault

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Markdown notes (those go in the appropriate numbered directory)
- Code files or non-image attachments

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with context, e.g.:
- `binary-search-flowchart.png`
- `spring-boot-architecture.png`
- `2026-02-17-whiteboard-session.jpg`

## Tips

- Keep images organized with clear names -- this folder can grow quickly.
- If an image is only relevant to one project, consider prefixing it with the project name.
- Periodically clean up orphaned images that are no longer referenced in any note.

# 000 Index

## Purpose

This is the **main hub** of your vault. Use this directory to store **Maps of Content (MOCs)** and index notes that serve as entry points to different areas of your knowledge base.

## How to Use

1. **Create MOC notes** here for each major topic you study (e.g., "Java MOC", "System Design MOC", "Algorithms MOC"). Use the `006 MOC` template from `700 Templates/`.
2. **Link everything from here.** Each MOC should link to relevant concept notes in `100 Notes/`, problems, projects, and resources.
3. **Start your sessions here** by navigating to the relevant MOC to see your progress and find what to work on next.

## What Belongs Here

- Maps of Content (MOCs) for major topics
- Master index notes that organize other notes by theme
- Dashboard-style notes that aggregate links across the vault

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Individual concept notes (those go in `100 Notes/`)
- Daily journals (those go in `200 Day Notes/`)
- Task lists (those go in `500 Todo/`)

## Tips

- Keep MOCs updated as you add new concept notes and projects.
- Use the status indicators from the MOC template to track your mastery at a glance.
- Think of this folder as your **table of contents** for the entire vault.

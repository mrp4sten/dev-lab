# 500 Todo

## Purpose

This is your **task management hub**. Use this directory to track tasks, priorities, backlogs, and goals across all areas of your life and learning.

## How to Use

1. **Create task notes** using the `009 Tasks` template from `700 Templates/`.
2. **Organize by context** -- you can have separate task notes for work, personal, learning, or side projects.
3. **Prioritize ruthlessly** using the Critical / High / Medium / Low system.
4. **Review regularly** -- process your inbox, update statuses, and reprioritize weekly.

## What Belongs Here

- Active task lists organized by priority and context
- Weekly and monthly goal tracking
- Backlog and "someday/maybe" lists
- Quick-capture inbox notes for ideas and tasks to process later

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Project-specific task breakdowns (keep those in the project note in `400 Projects/`)
- Daily to-do lists (those belong in your daily note in `200 Day Notes/`)

## Tips

- Use the "Quick Capture" inbox section to dump ideas fast, then process them later.
- Follow the 2-minute rule: if a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately.
- Do a weekly review every Sunday to clean up, reprioritize, and plan the next week.
- Track completed tasks to measure your velocity and celebrate progress.
- Use time estimates to avoid overcommitting your day.

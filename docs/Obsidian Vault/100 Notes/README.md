# 100 Notes

## Purpose

This is where all your **knowledge notes** live. Every concept, technique, pattern, or idea you learn gets its own note here.

## How to Use

1. **Create a new note** for each concept you study. Use the `001 Concept` or `002 Problem` templates from `700 Templates/`.
2. **Write in your own words.** The goal is understanding, not copying. Use the Feynman Test section to verify you truly grasp the material.
3. **Link related concepts** using `[[wikilinks]]` to build a web of connected knowledge.
4. **Tag your notes** with the relevant phase, topic, and understanding level so you can filter and review them later.

## What Belongs Here

- Concept notes (definitions, explanations, examples)
- Problem-solving notes (approach, solution, lessons learned)
- Technical reference notes (patterns, algorithms, data structures)
- Meeting notes (use the `007 Meeting` template)

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Daily reflections (those go in `200 Day Notes/`)
- Project documentation (those go in `400 Projects/`)
- External links without your own notes (those go in `300 Links/`)

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that make notes easy to find, e.g.:
- `Binary Search`
- `REST API Design Principles`
- `Observer Pattern`

## Tips

- Rate your understanding (0-10) honestly and revisit weak concepts.
- Always link new notes back to the relevant MOC in `000 Index/`.
- Use the "Related Concepts" section to create connections between notes.
